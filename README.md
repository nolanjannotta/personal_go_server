# Go http + ssh server

## Description:
A simple yet effective server that serves static html files to your browser and markdown files to your terminal


This is my very first project written in Go and acts as my own personal portfolio website. In building it I've learned the basics of Go, basics of Docker and cloud container hosting, and the Charm suite of Go libraries to build TUIs and ssh servers. Thanks for checking it out!
