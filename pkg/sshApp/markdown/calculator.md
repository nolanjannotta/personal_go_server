The first finished project that I ever deployed on mainnet. A fully functioning, fully onchain calculator. comes in 5 colors schemes. "Onchain" in this case means that the SVG code and javascript code are stored in the smart contract. Once the SVG is returned from the contract, your browser handles the rest and runs the logic. 9/10 collectors recommend minting this token.



✯note: This contract does not include 'animation_url' in the metadata, this means the calculator does not work on opensea. 




✯ normally a demo will go here. However I'm not sure how to get SVGs and javascript to run over ssh. Visit the web browser version for the full experience ✯
