⊚ ABOUT

Hello there! I'm Nolan, I like to make things both digital and physical. I'm a self taught programmer who loves learning and experimenting. Very eager to contribute to the world in anyway I can.

Some of my interests include blockchain, coding, terminal apps, generative art, AI, minimal design, jazz, metal working etc.

life goal: Build cool things that people enjoy.
