⊚ ABOUT

Hello there! I'm Nolan, I like to make things both digital and physical. I'm a self taught programmer who loves learning and experimenting. Very eager to contribute to the world in anyway I can.

Some of my interests include blockchain, coding, terminal apps, generative art, AI, minimal design, jazz, metal working etc.

life goal: Build cool things that people enjoy.


This site is a work in progress and acts as a resume/portfolio. Below you will find links and info to learn more about my previous and future projects.



Are you tired of awesome terminal UIs? Great news, this page is also available on your favorite web browser! Simply type " url here" into your search bar and hit enter.


Thanks for checking it out!

-Nolan
