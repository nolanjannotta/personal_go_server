A game of snake on Ethereum mainnet. Fully functioning SVG stored onchain. comes in 5 colors schemes. "Onchain" in this case means that the SVG code and javascript code are stored in the smart contract. Once the SVG is returned from the contract, your browser handles the rest and runs the game.

✯known bug: food CAN spawn underneath the snake. ✯






✯ normally a demo will go here. However I'm not sure how to get SVGs and javascript to run over ssh. Visit the web browser version for the full experience ✯
